Eclipse Table : gfcat_eclipse_table.csv

The GFCAT table of candidate eclipses contains one row / entry per lightcurve manually
identified as containing morphology possibly consistent with a stellar eclipse.
This table inherits all columns from the visit-level table, and the
definitions for those columns will be found in gfcat_visit_table_column_defs.txt.
