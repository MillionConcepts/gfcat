Visit Table : gfcat_visit_table.csv

The GFCAT visit-level table contains one row per lightcurve identified as consistent 
with astrophysical variability. Each lightcurve corresponds to one "source-visit": a
single observation of a specific source. Unless otherwise noted, all measurements in this
table were performed using a circular aperture with a radius of 17.5 arcseconds centered 
on the positions indicated by `ra` and `dec`. Some time values are in "GALEX Time" scale.
This is equivalent to UNIX Time minus 315964800, in seconds (i.e. GALEX TIME = UNIX TIME - 315964800).


NOTE: 
To improve human-readability of the table, two dashes "--" have been used as a missing-value
placeholder. In many data-processing applications, this value will need to be specified as a special 
constant or replaced with a valid special constant before analysis.
