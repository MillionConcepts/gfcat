Flare Table : gfcat_flare_table.csv

The GFCAT table of candidate flares contains one row for each lightcurve (source-visit) 
manually identified as morphologically flare-like. This table inherits many columns from 
the visit-level table; definitions for those columns can be found in 
gfcat_visit_table_defs.txt. This file describes columns unique to the flare table.

NOTE: 
All fluence and energy values are recorded in base-10 log scale. For instance, a value 
of 32 in the energy_NUV column means 10^32 ergs.

fluence_NUV : the integrated fluence of the flare in NUV [ergs / cm^2]
fluence_err_NUV : the error on the integrated fluence of the flare in NUV [ergs / cm^2]
fluence_FUV : the integrated fluence of the flare in FUV [ergs / cm^2]
fluence_err_FUV : the error on the integrated fluence of the flare in FUV [ergs / cm^2]
energy_NUV : the integrated energy of the flare in NUV [ergs]
energy_err_1_NUV : the lower error on the integrated energy of the flare in NUV [ergs]
energy_err_2_NUV : the upper error on the integrated energy of the flare in NUV [ergs]
energy_FUV : the integrated energy of the flare in FUV [ergs]
energy_err_1_FUV : the lower error on the integrated energy of the flare in FUV [ergs]
energy_err_2_FUV : the upper error on the integrated energy of the flare in FUV [ergs]
duration : the duration of the flare [sec]
left_censored : a flag indicating whether the flare extent includes the first time bin in the observation
right_censored : a flag indicating whether the flare extent includes the last time bin in the observation
peak_cps_NUV : the maximum value, in counts-per-second, of the NUV flare lightcurve
peak_cps_err_NUV : the counting error on cps of the maximum value in the NUV flare lightcurve

peak_t0_NUV : starting timestamp of bin containing the maximum value in the NUV flare lightcurve [sec, GALEX time scale]
peak_censored : a flag indicating whether the maximum value in the flare lightcurve is the first or
    last time bin, suggesting that the peak of the flare was not observed
quiescence_cps NUV : the estimated quiescence (instantaneous non-flare flux) of the NUV lightcurve in cps
quiescence_cps_err_NUV : the counting error in cps on the estimated quiescence in NUV
