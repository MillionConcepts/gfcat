# GFCat: The \[G]ALEX \[F]lare \[Cat]alog (+ other variables).
The GFCat project is mining the GALEX data for serendipitous variables observed by GALEX on timescales shorter than about 30 minutes (a full-depth GALEX visit). This is the working repository for that project.

**The major output of this project is a catalog 30-second depth photometry of intra-visit variables for all MIS style observations collected by GALEX through GR7.** The reference tables for this catalog appear in the `catalog` directory of this repository. The paper describing this output has been submitted and is in review. Much of the supporting software for that paper is contained in the `gfcat_paper/src` directory of this repository and is also available in the `gfcat_paper` repository: [https://github.com/millionconcepts/gfcat\_paper](https://github.com/millionconcepts/gfcat_paper)

Most of the supporting data for this project can be recreated from publicly available sources, including [gPhoton2](https://github.com/millionconcepts/gPhoton2). A full copy of the intermediate data is being retained by the PI in an institutional repository. Final data for GFCAT--comprising light curve files, QA images, and catalogs files--is publicly archived at **[LOCATION TBD]**.

A paper focused specifically on the analysis of the nearby active M dwarf system GJ65 appeared previously in ApJ:
`Fleming, Scott W., et al. "New Time-resolved, Multi-band Flares in the GJ 65 System with gPhoton." The Astrophysical Journal 928.1 (2022): 8.`
with supporting software available at [https://github.com/MillionConcepts/gfcat\_gj65](https://github.com/MillionConcepts/gfcat_gj65)

### Some important caveats:
* The contents of this repository were generated in support of a large, exploratory research effort spread over many years. They are similar in kind to unedited lab notebooks and should be approached with that attitude.
* The form and function are generally limited to what is required for that project and may not be appropriate for your project. Everything in this repository---unless specifically noted otherwise---is released under BSD 3-Clause license, so you may do nearly anything you wish with it. Citation of the source is very much appreciated, however.

A summary publication is in preparation. Prior to that, **if you use the contents of this repository in your research, cite it with the Zenodo identifier**: `Chase Million, Michael St. Clair, and Scott W. Fleming "GFCat" https://github.com/MillionConcepts/gfcat (2020). DOI:10.5281/zenodo.4147590.`
